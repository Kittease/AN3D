### Concept

This is a boid implementation in C++, using the [VCL](https://github.com/drohmer/epita_image_animation3d_vcl) library for an EPITA project in 3D animation given by [Damien Rohmer](https://github.com/drohmer).

## Compile the library and use

The compilation must be done with the following :
* **CMakeLists.txt** using CMake (Linux/MacOS/Windows)

Then, simply run the `pgm` binary and play with the GUI parameters to mess with the boids.
